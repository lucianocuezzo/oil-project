Sensitivity checklist (thesis)
------------------------------

Price curve
- Shift futures curve up/down.
- Steepen/flatten contango/backwardation.

Volatility
- Sigma low vs high to show option value of waiting/switching.

Discount rate
- Lower vs higher; effect on triggers and NPVs.

Costs
- Variable cost, fixed ON cost.
- Fixed OFF cost.
- Switch_on / switch_off costs.
- Capex.
- Salvage on/off and higher/lower.

Operational flex
- Allow immediate start ON vs force start OFF/Pre.
- Switching costs: zero, realistic, high.
- Horizon/time step: shorter vs longer horizon; finer dt.

Model calibration
- Lattice bounds (jmax/jmin): check convergence of tree-expected NPV/Bellman.
- Mean reversion (a): slower/faster; effect on price distribution.

Comparative benchmarks
- Static NPV (invest now, no wait/no switching).
- NPV with invest-later option (no switching).
- Bellman (full switching and timing).
- Sigma = 0 vs base sigma.

Scenario stress (optional)
- Price jump/drop scenarios.
- Rate/price co-movements if relevant.

Reporting
- Root values and recommended first action.
- Investment triggers over time for each model.
- ON/OFF policy regions for key sigma/cost scenarios.
